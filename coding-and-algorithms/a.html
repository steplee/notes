<h1>Tree Decompositions</h1>
<h2>Centroid Decomposition</h2>
<p>See [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pk02p1-weU](this Algorithms Live video)</p>
<ul>
<li>A tree <em>centroid</em> is a node that, when removed, maximizes the remaining two components
<ul>
<li>It/they must be either the <strong>single center</strong> or <strong>two middle nodes</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Can be used for divide and conquer approaches:</p>
<ol>
<li>Solve problem for all paths going through some node</li>
<li>Remove node</li>
<li>Solve sub-problems recursively</li>
</ol>
<h4>Ex. problem: Yin-Yang Paths</h4>
<p>find all balanced paths.</p>
<p><strong>Approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Root tree at centroid.</li>
<li>Solve recursively.
<ul>
<li>Store array starting at root, all elements will be accessed. But when solving sub-problems, only at-most half will be accessed, times the number of components that the centroid shatters.</li>
<li>Actually need two arrays, one for current recursion level that will replace the other when all children-components considered.</li>
<li>Each child-component shattered by a centroid will look at its sibiling-components, count # of balanced paths (e.g. [-1,2] ~ [-2,5] corresponds to 1 balanced path due to 2 and -2)</li>
<li>Then, update table and repeat on children-components.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
