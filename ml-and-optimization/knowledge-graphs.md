# Knowledge Graphs
## [Review Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.00759.pdf)
> There are two main classes of SRL techniques: those that capture the correlation between the nodes/edges using latent variables, and those that capture the correlation directly using statistical models based on the observable properties of the graph.

### 2. Intro to KGs
#### Representation of Knowledge
RDF: `<subject, predicate, object>`
#### Open v Closed assumption
Closed World Assumption: Non-existing RDF triplets indicate **false** facts
Open World Assumption: Non-existing RDF triplets indicante **unknown** facts
#### KG construction
Semi-supervised (regexs and learned rules) are key to scaling
Schema-based vs Schema-free
#### KG usages
#### Tasks
